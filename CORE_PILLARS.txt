OVERLORD GUIDING PRINCIPLES:

1. THAI-FIRST, GLOBAL-READY: 
Every feature must excel in the Thai context before scaling to international standards. If it doesn't understand "Kha/Khrap" or "Narak," it isn't ours.

2. CREATIVE EMPOWERMENT, NOT REPLACEMENT:
The AI is the assistant (Co-pilot). The human creator remains the Pilot. We automate the drudgery to liberate the imagination.

3. SPEED AS A FEATURE:
In the Thai production world, everything was needed "yesterday." Our platform must be the fastest route from "Brief" to "Action."

4. ETHICAL AI & LOCAL LAW:
Strict adherence to PDPA (Thailand) and intellectual property rights for Thai artists and creators.
