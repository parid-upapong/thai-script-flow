# Thai Creative Production AI Ecosystem Architecture

## 1. Core Intelligence Layer (The "Brain")
*   **Custom LLM (Thai-Creative-v1):** Specialized in Thai syntax, slang, and advertising tropes.
*   **Multi-modal Adapters:** Converting Thai text scripts directly into visual prompts and production schedules.

## 2. Production Modules (The "Workforce")
*   **Script-to-Scene:** Parses Thai dialogue to identify props, characters, and locations.
*   **Visual Continuity Engine:** Ensures character consistency across storyboards using LoRA technology tuned for Thai features.
*   **Audio Synthesis:** Thai Text-to-Speech (TTS) with emotional inflection (Excited, Sincere, Authoritative).

## 3. Cultural Context Layer (The "Moat")
*   **Cultural Guardrails:** AI filters to ensure compliance with Thai regulations (Alcohol/Tobacco laws) and cultural sensitivities.
*   **Trend Integration:** Direct API feed from local social trends to keep content relevant to the "Gen Z Thai" or "Mass Market" audience.

## 4. Integration Layer (The "Connector")
*   **Agency Dashboard:** Workspace management for creative directors and producers.
*   **Export Pipeline:** Direct export to Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and DaVinci Resolve.
